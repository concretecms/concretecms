/**
 * The $navItems variable is an array of objects, each representing a nav menu item.
 * It is a "flattened" one-dimensional list of all nav items -- it is not hierarchical.
 * However, a nested nav menu can be constructed from this "flat" array by
 * looking at various properties of each item to determine its place in the hierarchy
 * (see below, for example $navItem->level, $navItem->subDepth, $navItem->hasSubmenu, etc.)
 *
 * Items in the array are ordered with the first top-level item first, followed by its sub-items, etc.
 *
 * Each nav item object contains the following information:
 *	$navItem->url        : URL to the page
 *	$navItem->name       : page title (already escaped for html output)
 *	$navItem->target     : link target (e.g. "_self" or "_blank")
 *	$navItem->level      : number of levels deep the current menu item is from the top (top-level nav items are 1, their sub-items are 2, etc.)
 *	$navItem->subDepth   : number of levels deep the current menu item is *compared to the next item in the list* (useful for determining how many <ul>'s to close in a nested list)
 *	$navItem->hasSubmenu : true/false -- if this item has one or more sub-items (sometimes useful for CSS styling)
 *	$navItem->isFirst    : true/false -- if this is the first nav item *in its level* (for example, the first sub-item of a top-level item is TRUE)
 *	$navItem->isLast     : true/false -- if this is the last nav item *in its level* (for example, the last sub-item of a top-level item is TRUE)
 *	$navItem->isCurrent  : true/false -- if this nav item represents the page currently being viewed
 *	$navItem->inPath     : true/false -- if this nav item represents a parent page of the page currently being viewed (also true for the page currently being viewed)
 *	$navItem->attrClass  : Value of the 'nav_item_class' custom page attribute (if it exists and is set)
 *	$navItem->isHome     : true/false -- if this nav item represents the home page
 *	$navItem->cID        : collection id of the page this nav item represents
 *	$navItem->cObj       : collection object of the page this nav item represents (use this if you need to access page properties and attributes that aren't already available in the $navItem object)

/** For extra functionality, you can add the following page attributes to your site (via Dashboard > Pages & Themes > Attributes):
 *
 * 1) Handle: exclude_nav
 *    (This is the "Exclude From Nav" attribute that comes pre-installed with concrete5, so you do not need to add it yourself.)
 *    Functionality: If a page has this checked, it will not be included in the nav menu (and neither will its children / sub-pages).
 *
 * 2) Handle: exclude_subpages_from_nav
 *    Type: Checkbox
 *    Functionality: If a page has this checked, all of that pages children (sub-pages) will be excluded from the nav menu (but the page itself will be included).
 *
 * 3) Handle: replace_link_with_first_in_nav
 *    Type: Checkbox
 *    Functionality: If a page has this checked, clicking on it in the nav menu will go to its first child (sub-page) instead.
 *
 * 4) Handle: nav_item_class
 *    Type: Text
 *    Functionality: Whatever is entered into this textbox will be outputted as an additional CSS class for that page's nav item (NOTE: you must un-comment the "$ni->attrClass" code block in the CSS section below for this to work).
