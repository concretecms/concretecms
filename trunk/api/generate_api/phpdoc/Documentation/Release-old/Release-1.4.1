The phpDocumentor team would like to announce the release of phpDocumentor
1.4.1.  This release deprecates the usage of the old "phpdoc.php" and 
"new_phpdoc.php" webpage interfaces, in favor of the docbuilder interface...
the files remain in the application, but for now they automatically redirect
to the docbuilder interface.  This release also fixes some runtime execution 
bugs, provides a few  clarification updates to the manual, and establishes 
unit tests available to the "pear run-tests" command.

------
IMPORTANT:  phpDocumentor 1.4.1 requires PHP version 4.2.0 or greater.
phpDocumentor will function best with PHP version 4.3.0 or greater, as it will
use of the tokenizer extension if php 4.3.0 is installed for a tremendous
increase in parsing speed.  PHP version 5.1.0 or newer is recommended to take
advantage of PHP5-only features.

WARNING:  A bug in PHP v5.2.1 can cause PhpDocumentor v1.3.1 and older to
spiral into an infinite loop when parsing tutorial documents.  PhpDocumentor 
v1.3.2 and newer will crash itself at the beginning of the tutorial parsing 
stage if it detects PHP v5.2.1 being used to parse tutorials.
------

Speaking of speed, do NOT run the PDF Converter with --sourcecode = on for any
medium to large sized projects.  I had to kill a PDF generation after 36 hours
on a Pentium IV 2.66GHz computer - 36 hours!  The design of the PDF generation
library is tremendously inefficient, probably on the order of O(n^2).  I'd fix
this if I knew anything about PDF.  If there are any users out there with the
time and expertise to look into the algorithms used by CPdf, we would all
appreciate it.

A full listing of all closed bugs and feature requests can be found in the 
next section of the notes.

phpDocumentor 1.4.1 is ready for production use documenting any PHP project,
